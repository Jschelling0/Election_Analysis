## Election-Audit Summary
### Recommendations and Proposals
In future elections, this script can be used to help audit election data. When using this script in future elections, it is important that the headings of the columns remain as they are now. The current script would be ineffective if differet values were inputted differently then they are in the current data. One way in which the current script could be modified could be to help paint a better picture as to what is happening with all the provided data. For example, this script will only show who was the canidate with most votes, as well as to which county had the largest turnout. There is other information that could be acquired by modifying the script. For exaple, if any candidat wanted to see how they performed in each county, the script could be modified to help show each candidate how they performed in a certain county.
